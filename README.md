# My Movies
## Movie rating and watching list
My personal project will be a movie watching list. It will allow users to add different films that they'd like to watch while 
also allowing them to rate films they've already seen. This project would be useful to users of all ages and anyone who just enjoys 
watching movies and has a hard time keeping track of movies they want to see and rating movies they've already seen. This
project is of interest to me because I grew up in a family where we'd spend a lot of time watching different movies and shows together.

#Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on it, one of the biggest things I would change would be anything that has to do with Removing
and adding a movie. I'd name it something like MovieManager, and I'd have it be a centralized class that would handle
removing, updating and adding Movies. This would make the Project just overall neater, more functional, and more easily
scaled. I'd also change the format in which the lists were displayed as I did not exactly like how they look, as well
as taking more time to improve the GUI's functionality and overall looks.
