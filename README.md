# My Movies
## Movie rating and watching list
My personal project will be a movie watching list. It will allow users to add different films that they'd like to watch while 
also allowing them to rate films they've already seen. This project would be useful to users of all ages and anyone who just enjoys 
watching movies and has a hard time keeping track of movies they want to see and rating movies they've already seen. This
project is of interest to me because I grew up in a family where we'd spend a lot of time watching different movies and shows together.
